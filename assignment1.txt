Javascript Assignment 1



1. Create Javascript function that reverses a string. E.g. “Hello world” => “dlrow olleH”

2. Use above function to create function that performs word wise reverse function. E.g. “Hello world” => “olleH dlrow”

3. Create a function that capitalises each word of a sentence. E.g “javascRipt is a smart LanguAge. but it Requires too much effort.” => “JavascRipt Is A Smart LanguAge. But It Requires Too Much Effort.”

4. Try to run above function with some more efficiency, such that every word is capitalized and all remaining letters are converted to small case. E.g. “Javascript Is A Smart Language. But It Requires Too Much Effort.”

5. Use below code as template 
	var capital={
		'delhi':'Delhi',
		'uttar pradesh':'Lucknow',
		'haryana':'Chandigarh',
		'punjab':'Chandigarh',
		'uttarakhand':'Dehradoon'
	}

	var cities=[
		{city:'Agra',state:'Uttar Pradesh'},
		{city:'Faridabad',state:'Haryana'},
		{city:'West delhi',state:'Delhi'},
		{city:'Amritsar',state:'Punjab'},
		{city:'Nainital',state:'Uttarakhand'},
	]

	Now create a new array cityData from cities such that  every element contains object with city state and its capital. E.g {city:’Agra’, state:’Uttar Pradesh’, capital:’Lucknow’}
	
5. Create a function to convert a number into array of digits. 1234 => [1,2,3,4]. Make sure elements in array must be of type integer.

6. Create a function that finds sum of all elements of array of digits. [1,2,3,4] => 10.

7. Use above function to recursively add all elements of array until you get a single digit.

8. Check whether a list of digits is palindrome or not . [1,2,3,2,1] => true.

9. Use previous functions to check whether a string is palindrome or not.

10. Create a function that cleans(remove duplicates) an array of digits/strings.

11. Create a function that cleans(remove duplicates) from an array of objects.

12. Create a function (sorter) which takes a string argument. This function can be passed into any sort function of array of objects. The string will decide the key on which the array should be sorted.
E.g. students.sort(sorter(“name”)) -> Now sorter function must sort students with respect to name. Also make sure if the value in that key is a string array must be sorted without considering case.

13. Work on previous function and make sure if we pass “-” sign before the key the array must get sorted in descending order.
